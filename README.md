# try-daisyui

Welcome ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to try DaisyUI, which I heard takes tailwind and makes it even more awesome

The steps taken to get this repo to this point included:

1. Installing Tailwind like so https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite
2. Installing DaisyUI like so: https://daisyui.com/docs/install/
3. Copying the `tailwind.config.js` from this example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/daisyui-vite?file=tailwind.config.js
4. Enabling default themes like so: https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/
5. Using DaisyUI's theme generator to create and include my own custom theme like so: https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/

Confirmed, DaisyUI is awesome
